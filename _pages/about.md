Welcome to my website. I am a **Computer Science Ph.D.** student at **Arizona State University** and a research assistant at **ASU-Mayo Center for Innovative Imaging** ([AMCII](https://amcii.asu.edu/)). My advisor is Professor Baoxin Li, and my co-advisor is Professor Teresa Wu. My research interests lie in developing computer vision methods for medical image analysis—including but not limited to the tasks of supervised, weakly-supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised lesion segmentation, detection, and classification. I serve as a reviewer in many conferences and journals in my field. I have received **IEEE TMI Distinguished Reviewer—Bronze Level** and **IEEE TMI Distinguished Reviewer—Silver Level** awards from **IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging** and **Certificate of Outstanding Contribution in Reviewing** from the **Journal of Biomedical Informatics**. I also worked as **Applied Research Intern (Medical Imaging)** at **NVIDIA** during the summer of 2021 and 2022.

My complete CV is available [here](/cv). You can also download my CV in pdf format from here.
